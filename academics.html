<h4></br></h4>
<h4><b>Women&#39;s Safety in Indian Railways</b></h4>
<p align="justify">Using the Indian Railways Timetable Dataset, determined the need for special female security on railway platforms 
using the details of departure and arrival timing of the train, origin and destination cities and crime rate in those cities, using MapReduce.
Data set was taken from <a href="https://data.gov.in/catalog/indian-railways-train-time-table-0#web_catalog_tabs_block_10" target="_blank">here.</a> 
Code of the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/shwetabharti/Women-Safety-using-Big-Data" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<h4></br></h4>
<h4><b>Web Application for Named Entity Recognizer (NER)</b></h4>
<p align="justify">Developed a simple web application using Django framework for information extraction using NLTK library in python
that identifies the named entities in the text submitted by the user and displays the result.</p>
<br />

<h4><b>Classification of Breast Cancer Patients</b></h4>
<p align="justify">Classified breast cancer patients into two categories from the dataset - having malignant and benign cancer, using Python and Scikit-learn. 
Results from various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, LinearSVC, Perceptron and Naive Bayes were analyzed. Data Set was taken from 
University of California, Irvine Datasets available
