<h4><b>For the betterment of families of jail inmates</h4></b>
<p align="justify"> 
Associated with Siddhartha Vashishta Charitable Trust (SVCT), Delhi to work for the cause of betterment of family members, especially small children of people who are imprisoned. 
I was involved in many case studies and suggested the NGO suitable steps they should take to ameliorate the condition of the people from such families. 
In a specific case, we helped a young girl become self-sufficient and support her family of seven members when her father was incarcerated in a road accident case.</p>

<h4><b>For the education of children of prostitutes</h4></b>
<p align="justify"> 
Prostitutes are brought illegally on the gloomy streets where prostitution is prevalent and lacking a social identity deprive them and their children
from receiving social benefits. Along with my college friends, I worked for 15 of such children getting admissions in a government school and avail their
right for education and right to live with dignity.</p>
